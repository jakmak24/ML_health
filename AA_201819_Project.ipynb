If you have revealed a mental health issue to a coworker or employee, do you believe this has impacted you negatively? Do you believe your productivity is ever affected by a mental health issue? If yes, what percentage of your work time (time performing primary or secondary job functions) is affected by a mental health issue?  Do you have previous employers? Have your previous employers provided mental health benefits? Were you aware of the options for mental health care provided by your previous employers? Did your previous employers ever formally discuss mental health (as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)? Did your previous employers provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?  \\\n",

Why or why not?.1 Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt your career? Do you think that team members/co-workers would view you more negatively if they knew you suffered from a mental health issue? How willing would you be to share with friends and family that you have a mental illness? Have you observed or experienced an unsupportive or badly handled response to a mental health issue in your current or previous workplace? Have your observations of how another individual who discussed a mental health disorder made you less likely to reveal a mental health issue yourself in your current workplace? Do you have a family history of mental illness? Have you had a mental health disorder in the past? Do you currently have a mental health disorder?

If you have revealed a mental health issue to a coworker or employee, do you believe this has impacted you negatively? Do you believe your productivity is ever affected by a mental health issue? If yes, what percentage of your work time (time performing primary or secondary job functions) is affected by a mental health issue?  Do you have previous employers?

Have your observations of how another individual who discussed a mental health disorder made you less likely to reveal a mental health issue yourself in your current workplace?
